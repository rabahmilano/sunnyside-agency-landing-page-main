## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - A library of components
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessing
- [AOS JS](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) - Animate On Scroll Library

### What I learned

I learnt how to modify the style of a Material UI component using `makeStyles()`

```js
const useStyles = makeStyles({
  root: {
    display: "block",
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
  },
});

const customStyles = useStyles();
```
